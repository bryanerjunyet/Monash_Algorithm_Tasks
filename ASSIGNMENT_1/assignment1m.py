Assignment 1 - Intercepting a Friend on a Train Loop
This program determines the least cost driving path to intercept a friend who is riding a circular train route.
The interception must occur at a train station at the exact same time, and you cannot wait at any location.

Approach:
- Use Dijkstra's algorithm to explore all possible driving paths.
- At each train station reached, calculate whether the friend arrives at the same time.
- Use a MinHeap to ensure efficient cost and time prioritization.

Time Complexity: O(|R| log |L|)
Space Complexity: O(|L| + |R|)
